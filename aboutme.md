<div class="about-title">
<h1>Hey, I'm <span style="color: #8103ff;">ProfessorShroom</span></h1>
</div>

<span style="font-size: 20px;">I'm a computer technician, gamer, car enthusiast, occasional coder and designer.</span>

<span style="font-size: 20px;">I often start projects for my current needs in computers or my cars. So this a place for my current, future and past projects!</span>

<span style="font-size: 20px;"> This page is just a bit fun, I was always sad that whoever owns [WUPHF.com](https://wuphf.com) never did anything with it, so I did.</span>
